Project No: 7
Project Due Date: 6th Dec, 2014
Project Description: Menu & AI

The Specs that I implemented are: All

Extras:

The asteroids/rocks sprites are the smart sprites which are moving around
in an artificially intelligent manner trying to avoid the player.

I have incorporated the reset feature, which I hadn't done in project 6. On pressing R
the curent game will stop and a new game will start with health and other features resetted.

When the game concludes, a HUD will pop up at the middle of the screen and on it will be
written whether the player has won or lost. This HUD will stay on the screen for 2 seconds
after which the menu page will reappear.
