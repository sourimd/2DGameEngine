This is a 2D Game that I build as part of Object Oriented Software Design Course.
I used C++ and SDL 1.2 API for the same.

Install the followings:-

Install clang++
Install g++
Install expat

Install:
  libsdl1.2-dev
  libsdl-mixer1.2-dev
  libsdl-image1.2-dev
  libsdl-gfx1.2-dev
  libsdl-sound1.2-dev
  libsdl-ttf2.0-dev

Run make to compile the code and then run it.
