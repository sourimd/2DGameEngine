Project No: 4
Project Due Date: 21 Oct 2014
Project Description: Tracker

The Specs that I implemented are: 1-11, from Extra for Experts- 2,3
Extra: I have used 3 sprites. They are, bat(2 way multi-sprite), snowflakes(rotating and lots of them(number of snowflakes are getting extracted from game.xml)) and green star(rotating). I have added additional key press events. If you press "i" , one bat sprite will get introduced into the world, if you press "j" one green star will get introduced. If you want to delete any sprite first track that and then press "d" i.e. by pressing "d" you can delete only the sprite you are tracking.
